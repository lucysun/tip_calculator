tip_calculator
==============
Three versions of a program that calculates restaurant tip and total bill value, based on input values of meal cost, tax rate, and tip rate:

1. raw_input.py accepts input through raw_input.

2. sysargv.py accepts input through sys.argv.

3. optparse.py accepts input through optparse OptionParser. The program sets a default tip rate of 20% and raises errors if a meal and tax rate are not specified.
